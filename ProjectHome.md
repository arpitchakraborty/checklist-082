My own checklist manager written in PHP & doesn't require any database since it is using flat file to store database. Therefore it is very fast and suitable as portable app (can run it from flash drive) - if you keep changing workspace across multiple computers

This project uses
  * Blueprint CSS framework (http://www.blueprintcss.org)
  * Fugue Icon (http://p.yusukekamiyamane.com/)
